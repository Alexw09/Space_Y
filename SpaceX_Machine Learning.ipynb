Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p-06ZOTa_iVj"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing\\_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ql4NemA7_iVk"},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-vyFKunu_iVm"},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5QoQYKZ-_iVn"},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.
